# eBTC Timelock Transparency Dashboard

## Description

The eBTC Timelock Transparency Dashboard is a web application designed to monitor and display transactions for the [eBTC Minimized Governance](https://forum.badger.finance/t/ebtc-minimized-governance-framework/6168) Timelocks and their state. It provides users with a real-time view of the state of transactions within the HighSec and LowSec Timelock contracts deployed on Sepolia and Ethereum Mainnet. By integrating with The Graph and Etherscan, the dashboard showcases transaction details such as ID, target, data, salt, timestamp, ETA, and the current stateâ€”scheduled, executed, or cancelled.

eBTC uses Open Zeppelin's TimelockController [contract](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol).
